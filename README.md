# AWS_Solution_Architect_Associate

I have made use of Selenium and a webdriver to create quizzes using Google Forms. You could re-use the code to create your own quizzes from the pdf's. Ensure the regex pattern(which helps to uniquely identify the questions) used in the code matches that of the question's in the pdf.
